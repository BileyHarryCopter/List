Main purpose of this project is working with such structure of data like a *List*.

## Features of data structure ##

List is a such data structure which has next features:

1. Addition in the list has asymptotics **o(1)** ([read about asymptotics here](http://cs.mipt.ru/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/02-resource.pdf)).

2. Delete operation has asymptotics **o(1)**.

3. Finding an element in the list has asymptotics

    3.1. **o(N)** in common case, where N - number of elements of the list.
    3.2. **o(1)** in case with linearizated list.
